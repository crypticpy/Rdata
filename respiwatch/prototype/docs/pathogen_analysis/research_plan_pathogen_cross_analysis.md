# Cross-Pathogen Detective Analysis: H3N2 Surveillance Anomaly Detection

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Surveillance Data Collection
- [x] 1.1 Collect current H3N2 surveillance data from WHO, CDC, ECDC
- [x] 1.2 Gather COVID-19 variant surveillance data
- [x] 1.3 Compile RSV, adenovirus, and other respiratory pathogen data
- [x] 1.4 Obtain historical H3N2 epidemiological baseline data

### Phase 2: Cross-Reference Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Compare H3N2 reports against influenza surveillance
- [x] 2.2 Analyze correlation patterns with COVID-19 variants
- [x] 2.3 Cross-check with non-influenza respiratory pathogen activity
- [x] 2.4 Identify geographical and temporal inconsistencies

### Phase 3: Pattern Detection
- [x] 3.1 Search for H3N2 reports in atypical seasons/locations
- [x] 3.2 Analyze severity patterns vs. known H3N2 strains
- [x] 3.3 Investigate transmission patterns and persistence
- [x] 3.4 Look for clinical presentation anomalies
- [x] 3.5 Check for dual infection reports

### Phase 4: Laboratory Investigation
- [x] 4.1 Search for diagnostic testing limitations reports
- [x] 4.2 Look for "pending" or "unusual" test results
- [x] 4.3 Identify surveillance gaps and testing capabilities
- [x] 4.4 Analyze laboratory testing patterns

### Phase 5: Anomaly Synthesis
- [x] 5.1 Synthesize suspicious patterns
- [x] 5.2 Generate cross-analysis report
- [x] 5.3 Document data inconsistencies and potential misclassifications

### Key Data Sources to Investigate:
- WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)
- CDC FluView surveillance data
- ECDC European surveillance
- COVID-19 variant surveillance (Outbreak.info, Nextstrain)
- RSV surveillance networks
- Laboratory testing capability reports
- Regional health authority reports

### Analysis Focus Areas:
1. Temporal anomalies (H3N2 in off-season periods)
2. Geographic inconsistencies (regions without typical flu patterns)
3. Severity patterns (unusual mortality/morbidity)
4. Laboratory testing anomalies
5. Co-infection patterns
6. Testing capability limitations

### Expected Deliverable:
