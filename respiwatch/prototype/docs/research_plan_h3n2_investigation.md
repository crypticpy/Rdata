# H3N2 Influenza Outbreak Investigation Research Plan
**Research Date**: December 6, 2025  
**Investigation Focus**: Official H3N2 influenza outbreak reports as of December 5th, 2025

## Task Complexity Assessment
**Complex Task** - Requires systematic analysis of multiple official sources, data verification, and investigative work to identify inconsistencies and unusual patterns.

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
- [x] Search WHO, CDC, ECDC, PAHO official reports and surveillance data
- [x] Review health ministry announcements from major countries (US, UK, EU, China, Japan, Australia, Canada)
- [ ] Identify countries officially reporting H3N2 outbreaks
- [ ] Gather outbreak timelines and progression data
- [ ] Document official case numbers, hospitalization rates, and mortality

## DETECTIVE WORK COMPONENTS
- [ ] Look for inconsistencies between what different agencies report
- [ ] Identify unusual timing patterns or geographic spread that doesn't match typical H3N2
- [ ] Check for missing data, delayed reporting, or suspicious gaps
- [ ] Compare current reports to historical H3N2 patterns
- [ ] Look for any mentions of "unusual respiratory illness" vs specifically H3N2
