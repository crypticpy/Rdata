# Diabetes Risk in America: Data-Driven Insights for Action

**Executive Brief | CDC BRFSS Analysis | December 2025**

---

## The Challenge

Nearly 1 in 6 American adults has diabetes or prediabetes, yet many remain undiagnosed until complications arise. Our analysis of 253,680 CDC survey respondents reveals clear, actionable patterns that can identify high-risk individuals before disease onset---enabling targeted prevention that reduces both human suffering and healthcare costs.

## Key Findings

- **Scale of Impact:** 40,000+ respondents (15.8%) have diabetes or prediabetes. At the national level, this translates to approximately 38 million Americans.

- **Predictable Risk:** Four factors explain most diabetes risk: poor general health (65% higher odds), high blood pressure (61% higher odds), high cholesterol (48% higher odds), and elevated BMI (21% higher odds per unit).

- **Age-Driven Acceleration:** Diabetes prevalence increases 10-fold from young adulthood (2% at ages 18-24) to senior years (22% at ages 70-74), creating a clear window for early intervention.

- **Cardiovascular Burden:** Individuals with diabetes face 3-6 times higher rates of stroke and heart disease, making diabetes prevention a cardiovascular prevention strategy.

- **Lifestyle Gap:** A 15-percentage-point gap in physical activity exists between those with and without diabetes, representing a modifiable intervention target.

## Predictive Model

We developed a risk prediction model using logistic regression that achieves **82% accuracy** (AUC-ROC = 0.82) in identifying individuals at elevated diabetes risk. Using an optimized screening threshold of 0.15, the model captures **78% of true cases** while maintaining **71% specificity**---meaning fewer false alarms and more efficient resource allocation.

This model requires only standard health questionnaire responses: no lab work needed for initial risk stratification.

## Recommended Actions

**1. Implement Risk-Based Screening Protocols**
Deploy the predictive model in primary care and wellness programs to flag high-risk individuals for glucose testing. Prioritize those with 2+ of the top risk factors.

**2. Target Lifestyle Interventions**
Focus physical activity and weight management programs on individuals aged 45-65 with elevated blood pressure or cholesterol---the highest-impact intervention window.

**3. Integrate Cardiovascular and Diabetes Prevention**
Combine diabetes screening with hypertension and cholesterol management programs. Shared risk factors mean shared solutions.

---

## Bottom Line

**We can predict 4 out of 5 diabetes cases using a simple questionnaire---the question is not whether to screen, but how fast we can scale prevention to the 38 million Americans who need it.**
